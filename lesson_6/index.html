            <h2>Famous paintings by Van Gogh and their stories</h2>
            <p>Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) is one of the most famous figures in art history. Despite a tragically cut career and lack of recognition during his lifetime, his paintings are now regarded as some of the most beautiful works of art ever created.</p>
            <p>The Amsterdam Van Gogh Museum recently won Best Museum in the World 's <a href="https://github.com/ev1lage">Outstanding Venue Awards</a> (with over 6,000 votes), now is the time to explore Van Gogh's work. From starry nights to beautiful sunflowers, here's a guide to Van Gogh's most famous paintings and their features.</p>

            <h3> Why is this painting famous?</h3>
            <p>The Starry Night is likely to be at the top of anyone's list when it comes to naming Van Gogh's most famous pieces. You'll find it on posters, novelty socks, bags, computer backgrounds, tattoos on your arms - you name it. You'll also find it on the walls of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where it's one of the museum's most eye-catching pieces (which really says a lot considering the number of <a href="#">other amazing paintings in the MoMA collection</a> ).
            </p>
            <p>Starlight Nightit's not just one of Van Gogh's most popular paintings; it is one of the most iconic works of art in existence. His spectacular swirling night sky filled with Expressionist spirals continues to evoke strong emotional responses from viewers to this day.</p>
            <h3>What backstory?</h3>
            <p>Although this post is about Van Gogh's famous paintings and not the artist's biography, his life cannot be ignored when you write about his art. Van Gogh voluntarily checked himself into a psychiatric hospital in Saint-Remy-de-Provence in 1889, a few months after the infamous episode in which he mutilated his left ear. This painting was based on the view from his window at the orphanage.
            </p>
            <p>Some art historians speculate that the painting was created in an agitated state, which is reflected in the almost hallucinatory nature of the work and potentially reinforced by the fact that Van Gogh experienced a second breakdown just a month later. Starry night has been fulfilled.
            </p>
            <div class="visibility">
                <p>Despite now being considered one of the most valuable works of art in history, Van Gogh seems to have personally regarded the painting as a failed experiment. It was only briefly mentioned in a letter to his brother Theo as an "overnight study", several months after it had already been written. He later decided not to send the painting to the Netherlands (stating that he greatly preferred other works) and eventually called his masterpiece "unsuccessful" in a letter to fellow artist Émile Bernard.

            <h3>Why is this painting famous?</h3>
            <div class="opacity">
                <p>When people talk about Starry Night, they usually mean the first painting on this list, but they may very well mean Starry Night over the Rhone instead. Likewise striking in its depiction of the night sky (albeit with fewer spirals), this painting has a slightly more peaceful feel than its counterpart, but has the classic color palette that Van Gogh became known for.

            <div class="outline">
                <h3>What backstory?</h3>
                <p>Van Gogh seems to have been particularly fascinated by the night sky and the gaslight visible across the water at Arles. He was excited enough by this painting to give it to his friend, the painter Eugène Boch, as a sketch, and the work was publicly exhibited in 1889 at the Société des Artistes Indépendants in Paris.

            </div>
            <div class="overflow">
                <p>He also described the painting in almost loving detail in one of the many letters he wrote to his brother Theo, describing him as“... The starry sky, painted at night, is actually under a jet of gas. The sky is aquamarine, the water is royal blue, the earth is mauve. The city is blue and purple. The gas is yellow, and the reflections are red-gold, fading to green-bronze. On the aquamarine field of the sky, the Big Dipper is a sparkling green-pink, whose restrained pallor contrasts with the brutal gold of the gas. In the foreground are two colorful figurines of lovers.
